# Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the exercises and projects for the Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing course.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sentiment Analysis with Traditional ML

#### Description

In this exercise, you will implement sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning techniques and simple neural networks.

#### Key Concepts Covered

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal)
- Feature extraction and encoding (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, word2vec)
- Traditional ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Model evaluation and comparison metrics


### Exercise 2: Sentiment Analysis with Convolutions

#### Description

In this exercise, you will implement a sentiment analysis model using CNNs. The model will be trained to classify text into positive or negative sentiment.

#### Key Concepts Covered

- Implement the sentiment analysis model using CNNs.
- Explore different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Perform a mechanistic interpretability analysis of the model, visualizing the activations of the model.
