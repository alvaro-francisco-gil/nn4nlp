This repository contains the exercises and projects for the Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing course.

## Exercises

### Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

### Exercise 1: Sentiment Analysis with Traditional ML

#### Description

In this exercise, you will implement sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning techniques and simple neural networks.

#### Instructions

1. Preprocess the text data (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
2. Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words
3. Implement and train Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers
4. Compare the performance of different models
5. Evaluate the models on the test dataset

#### Key Concepts Covered

- Text preprocessing techniques (lemmatization, stop word removal, etc.)
- Encoding methods (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, word2vec)
- Traditional ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Model evaluation metrics


### Exercise 2: Sentiment Analysis with Convolutions

#### Description

In this exercise, you will implement a sentiment analysis model using CNNs. The model will be trained to classify text into positive or negative sentiment.

#### Instructions

1. Implement the sentiment analysis model using CNNs.
2. Explore different architectures and hyperparameters.
3. Perform a mechanistic interpretability analysis of the model, visualizing the activations of the model.
